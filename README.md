# SWApi
 
A simple SPA based on the Star Wars API site (https://swapi.dev/), built with Angular 11 (https://angular.io/), using Bootstrap 4.5 (https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/). Basically two buttons, each of which renders a table with either Star Wars Vehicles or Star Wars Starships. Simple and fun project, used to demonstrate the getting of information from an API, building components and rendering them via Bootstrap. May the force be with you.
